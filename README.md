# pps-frontend-logs-monitor

## Description

The **pps-frontend-logs-monitor** project is a React-based frontend application designed to monitor and visualize logs generated by various backend applications within the AIT-CS-IaaS organization. This monitoring system focuses on four key applications:

1. **Camera Service (Repository: [pps-camera](https://github.com/ait-cs-IaaS/pps-camera))**
   - Provides visual data through camera feeds.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication with Access Control Policy (Repository: [pps-mfa-acp](https://github.com/ait-cs-IaaS/pps-mfa-acp))**
   - Implements multi-factor authentication along with access control policies.

3. **Facial Recognition System (Repository: [pps-frs](https://github.com/ait-cs-IaaS/pps-frs))**
   - Utilizes facial recognition technology for identity verification.

4. **Centralized Access Control System (Repository: [pps-cacs](https://github.com/ait-cs-IaaS/pps-cacs))**
   - Manages access control centrally across the entire system.

This React frontend serves as a unified dashboard to monitor the logs generated by these applications, all of which are powered by Flask on the backend. The user-friendly interface allows administrators and operators to track activities, errors, and events in real-time, providing valuable insights into the performance and security of the integrated services.
